## [v0.35.2](https://github.com/jonz94/Sarasa-Gothic-Nerd-Fonts/compare/v0.35.1...v0.35.2) (2021-11-28)

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

- In previous version, all variants of the patched fonts have exact same TTF font family name `Sarasa Nerd Font`. Now, each variant of the patched fonts will have proper TTF font family name. See [List of TTF Font Family Name](docs/ttf-font-family-name.md) for more details.

- You will need to apply changes to the font setting of the application after updating fonts to this version. For example: in order to using newer version of `sarasa-mono-tc-nerd-font.zip` in vscode, apply the following changes to vscode's `settings.json`:

```diff
-  "editor.fontFamily": "Sarasa Nerd Font",
+  "editor.fontFamily": "Sarasa Mono TC Nerd Font",
```
